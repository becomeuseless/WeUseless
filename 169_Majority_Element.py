'''
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

    Using Hashmap
    Counter is a subclass of dictionary object. The Counter() function in collections                   module takes an iterable or a mapping as the argument and returns a Dictionary.             In this dictionary, a key is an element in the iterable or the mapping and                 value is the number of times that element exists in the iterable or the                     mapping.
